# Return-to-Harmony
A beautiful, therapeutic web page with two modes of relaxation, music and meaningful quotes. A visual and auditory way to de-stress for a time.

*** IMPORTANT: PLEASE ALLOW AUDIO AND VIDEO IN YOUR BROWSER AND REFRESH TO LOAD WITH SOUND! ***

The sun above the horizon on the first page was created by myself with a simple canvas element: it is not part of the background image!

The two modes can be switched in the top right of the nav bar, and at the top left you will find a quote 'pause' button.

The program uses screen coordinate pixel calculations to track the quotations flow across the screen, pausing centrally and then falling away in a smooth arc.

Arrays for the quotes are stored in a different file.

The page uses gentle animations to compliment the rest of the aesthetics, and the two different modes are contemplative in different ways.

This idea was born out of a quote generator project that I saw was a popular project when trying to learn a programming language.

However, I decided to blend my love of writing and philosophy with a way of relaxing an internet user in both a visual and musical way.

We use webpages to accomplish a task now. For once, why not just enjoy one for a few minutes and take a time out?

One day, I'd like to expand this to include several modes and invite other designers to contribute their own stories or quotes.

The idea is that the page shows something about who they are and pass on to others supportive messages and life experience.

There should be NO interactions with the creator of any kind. It needs to be haunting and meaningful; always in the past.
